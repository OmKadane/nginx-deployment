## ℹ️ About The Project

This repository demonstrates a **complete workflow** for deploying a static website to a live **Nginx server**.  

It showcases two methods of deployment:  
- A **manual pull** method from the server.  
- A **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Webhooks.  

The automated system uses a **GitHub Webhook** to send a signal to a custom **Python/Flask** listener running on the server.  
This listener executes a shell script to pull the latest changes, updating the website automatically within seconds after a `git push`.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Web Server:** Nginx  
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu (on WSL or Linux server)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Automation:** GitHub Webhooks  
- **Webhook Listener:** Python with Flask  
- **Tunneling Service (local dev):** ngrok  
- **Frontend:** HTML & CSS

## 🔄 Deployment Workflows

This project supports two deployment methods:

### A. Manual Deployment
After pushing changes to GitHub, SSH into the server and pull the latest version.

```bash
# On the server
cd /var/www/html
sudo git pull origin main

```

### B. Automated CI/CD Deployment

A **hands-off** approach: simply `git push` and the live site updates automatically.

#### How It Works
1.  Developer runs `git push`.
2.  GitHub sends a webhook notification to a public URL.
3.  `ngrok` tunnels this notification to the **Flask listener** on the server.
4.  Flask receives the signal and executes `deploy.sh`.
5.  The script runs `sudo git pull` to update the website files.

## 🚀 Initial Server Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Linux server with **Nginx** and **Git** installed.
- Python 3 + `pip` (for the automated workflow).

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the project into the Nginx web root:
```bash
# Navigate to the web server directory
cd /var/www

```
# Clone the repo
```
sudo git clone [https://github.com/OmKadane/nginx-deployment.git](https://github.com/OmKadane/nginx-deployment.git)

```
# Replace existing html folder with project
```
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html
sudo mv /var/www/nginx-deployment /var/www/html

```
### 3. Configure Nginx

Create a server block inside `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_ip;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;
    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

```
Then restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx

```
👉 For automated deployment, see [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh) and [`webhook.py`](./webhook.py).

```
```
